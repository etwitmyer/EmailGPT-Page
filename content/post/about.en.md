## Vision  
**The Problem**  
Long email threads can be difficult to follow—especially when new recipients are added mid-conversation. Important information often gets buried under pleasantries, redundant quoting, and off-topic messages.

**Our Solution**  
EmailGPT offers a better way to manage email:

- A high-level summary of the full conversation  
- Message-by-message breakdowns that extract only meaningful content  
- Detection and tracking of action items and tasks  
- AI-suggested responses integrated directly into the Gmail interface

- **Cut Through the Noise:** Filter out fluff and repetition  
- **Work Smarter:** Use suggested replies to respond efficiently  
- **Stay on Track:** Clearly monitor outstanding tasks and requests
