## What is EmailGPT?  

**Your AI-powered assistant for managing complex email threads**
EmailGPT is a Chrome Extension that enhances Gmail by summarizing, organizing, and clarifying long email conversations. Designed for users who frequently deal with lengthy threads, EmailGPT helps you:

- Summarize entire conversations into concise highlights  
- Break down individual messages with redundant content filtered out  
- Automatically identify and highlight action items and requests  
- Suggest smart replies using AI integration  

Stay informed, respond quickly, and reduce email fatigue—all from within your email app.

## Vision  
**The Problem**  
Long email threads can be difficult to follow—especially when new recipients are added mid-conversation. Important information often gets buried under pleasantries, redundant quoting, confusing indentation, and off-topic messages.

**Our Solution**  
EmailGPT offers a better way to manage email:

- Integration with Gemini API key access
- A high-level summary of the entire email thread
- A chronological breakdown of individual messages, highlighting unique and relevant content
- Extraction and display of action items or requests of email chain
- Suggested response to the most recent email with all context
- A clean, non-disruptive overlay UI that appears within email for convenient access
- Saved most recent analysis for ease of access

## Why EmailGPT?  

- **Save Time:** Instantly see what matters  
- **Cut Through the Noise:** Filter out fluff and repetition  
- **Work Smarter:** Use suggested replies to respond efficiently  
- **Stay on Track:** Clearly monitor outstanding tasks and requests
